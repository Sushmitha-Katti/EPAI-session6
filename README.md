<h1 align = "center"><b>First Class Functions Part I</b></h1>
This session was all about docstrings, annotations, lambda Expression, Functional Introspection, Callables, Map, filter and zip

## **Assignment**
vals = ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'jack', 'queen', 'king', 'ace']

suits = ['spades', 'clubs', 'hearts', 'diamonds']

1. Write a single expression that includes lambda, zip and map functions to select create 52 cards in a deck 
2. Write a normal function without using lambda, zip, and map function to create 52 cards in a deck 
3. Write a function that, when given 2 sets of 3 or 4 or 5 cards (1 game can only have 3 cards with each player or 4 cards or 5 cards per player) (1 deck of cards only), (2 players only), can identify who won the game of poker (Links to an external site.)

## **Functions**

### **1. create_deck_cards_single_expression** 
This function creates all 52 cards from vals and suits using lambda and map function in a single line

```python
def create_deck_cards_single_expression():
    cards = []
    list(map(lambda x: list(map(lambda y: cards.append((x,y)), suits)),vals))
    return cards
```

### **2. create_deck_cards_normal_function**
This function creates all 52 cards from vals and suits without using lambda and map function
```python

def create_deck_cards_normal_function():
    cards = []

    for val in vals:
        for suit in suits:
            cards.append((val, suit))
    return cards
```
### **3. play_poker_game**
This function evaluates which player has won poker game.

### **Rules**
